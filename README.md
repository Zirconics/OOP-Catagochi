# Catagochi Game

In the `src` directory you will find the start of the Catagochi game. 
In `build` is a basic index.html and a stylesheet. Feel free to change as you need.

## Running Catagochi

Before you are able to run the Catagochi game it is needed to run the `npm install` command.
After installing the various modules run either `npm run build` or `npm run watch`.
Open the application with one of the webservers described below. 

## Webserver

Applications built with es6 modules must be run on a webserver. On Visual Studio Code, [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) is recommended. Otherwise [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/) can be used.

## ts-skeleton-app 

This repository is based on [ts-skeleton-app](https://github.com/HZ-HBO-ICT/ts-skeleton-app)
All *.js build artifacts in the `build` directory are ignored.
